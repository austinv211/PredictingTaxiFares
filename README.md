# Predicting Taxi Fares in New York
- a data science project on predicting taxi fares

## Getting Started
- Clone the project
- download the project data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/data
- place the csv's in a project folder called projectDataFiles (our whatever youd like)
- the project files are quite large so the group is looking into feathering the data for faster load times
